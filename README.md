Comedy Events Application that uses the Ticketmaster API to show which comedy events are taking place in Boston and gives a little bit of information about each event.

How It's Made: Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Fetch

The objective of this project was to create an app on that would be able to let users know what comedy events are happening in boston.

Optimization I would like to add to the design and add the ability to search for events by a comedians name.

Lessons Learned: I learned how to utilize the fetch api before this I had only used jquery for making api calls before this.

Installation: Clone repo, Open index2.html
